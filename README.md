# Waitless App

Application still in development by 4 flatiron developers.

## Purpose

Waitless is the brainchild of four developers who had a vision for creating a seamless and painless customer experience for restaurant goers everywhere. The idea was fostered during a Flatiron hackathon to write a program where foodies can enjoy the full experience restaurant business owners provide by lessoning the workload of the server and giving more control to the customer. The Waitless app allows seated customers at a restuarant to order menu items, customize order, call floor staff, and complete payment process - all performed on a tablet.
